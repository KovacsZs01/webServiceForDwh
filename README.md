Hello! This code is for the web service component of my BSc Computer Science university thesis project. For the project I integrated data from 3 separate data sets into a star schema and created a Data warehouse in PostgreSQL. Then I created this Web Service component to display chart.js visualisations based on SQL query results in a clear user interface. The PostgreSQL server is connected to the web service component with pg. The SQL queries are run based on API requests sent from the frontend so the visualisations reflect changes made in the data warehouse as soon as a new API request is sent for the data.

This project has been a huge learning opportunity for me. Improvements coming soon!
