Hello! This code is for the web service component of my BSc Computer Science university thesis project. For the project I created a data warehouse in PostgreSQL from 3 separate data sets, integrated them into a star schema and then I created this Web Service component to display visualisations based on SQL queries using chart.js. The connection to the PostgreSQL server was provided by the pg library. The SQL queries run based on API requests sent from the frontend. 
This project has been a huge learning opportunity for me and some improvements are coming soon! 
React, node.js, TypeScript
